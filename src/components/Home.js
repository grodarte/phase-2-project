            <h1>Christmas shopping doesn't need to look like this...</h1>

            <p>
                That's why I put together this easy app where you can see my wishlist and 
                order everything online! No more long lines or feeling like you're playing tackle football.

                The app is easy to manuever. If you'd like to view gifts to purchase, you can view them under the Wishlist tab.
                Once you purchase a gift, make sure to mark it as purchased in the app so no one buys duplicates! 

                No need to worry about the Add New Gift tab, this is for me to add new gift ideas to my wishlist. 
                Excited to celebrate with everyone!
