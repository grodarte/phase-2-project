          That's why I put together this easy app where you can see my wishlist
          and order everything online! No more long lines or feeling like
          you're playing tackle football.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is easy to maneuver. If you'd like to view gifts to purchase,
          you can view them under the <strong>Wishlist</strong> tab. Once you
          purchase a gift, make sure to mark it as purchased in the app so no
          one buys duplicates!
        </p>
        <p>
          No need to worry about the <strong>Add New Gift</strong> tabâ€”this is
          for me to add new gift ideas to my wishlist.
        </p>

          ~ Excited to celebrate with everyone! ~
